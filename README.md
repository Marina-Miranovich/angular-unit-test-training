# angular-training-overlay

Prepare to the training:
* Clone the project;
* Have any simple server to serve your static files localy (i use [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server). But it's not an only option, you could use [grunt-serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-serve) or something else)
